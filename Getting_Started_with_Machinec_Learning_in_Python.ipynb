The frequency of massive planets around stars of open clusters such as M67 turns out to be very similar to that of field stars.,2455679.9,,2014,Confirmed planets,0.31,6.960,RV,18/03/23,109.16,YBP1194 b\\n0.40,YBP1514 is a main sequence star in the open star cluster M67. It hosts a 0.4 Jupiter mass planet. The star cluster is between 3.2 and 5 billion years old and contains many stars with ages and compositions similar to that of our own Sun.,2455986.3,,2014,Confirmed planets,0.27,5.118,RV,18/03/23,328.58,YBP1514 b\\n0.42,YBP401 b is a hot Jupiter in an eccentric orbit around an F-type star in the open cluster M67.,2456072.4,,2016,Confirmed planets,0.16,4.087,RV,18/03/23,343.33,YBP401 b\\n'"
